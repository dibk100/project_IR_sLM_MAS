This diff sets the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` in the settings file, ensuring that all models use a manually specified primary key instead of an auto-created one. Additionally, it removes the primary key definition from the `User` model since it is inherited from the `Entity` model.
